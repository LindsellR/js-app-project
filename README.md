## Pokedex - Pokemon List App

Welcome to my simple web application made with **HTML, CSS, and Javascript** that fetches information about Pokemon, accessing dat from the **PokeAPI.** The Pokedex app allows users to view a list of Pokemon and access details about each one, such as images, abilities and more.

##Running The App
Here are the steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

2. Navigate to the project directory
cd js-app-project

3. Open the index.html file in your browser to start the application

## Using The App.

Once the app is loaded in your browser you will see the pokemon names in a list.

* Click on any pokemon to open a modal 

* The modal displays an image and some details about the pokemon.

* You can close the modal by clicking the "Close " button or clicking anywhere outside the modal, or by using the escape key on your keyboard.
